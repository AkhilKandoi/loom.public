### Write your thoughts and save them securely so only you can read them.

Loom is a secure, private online diary web app designed to protect your most personal thoughts. If you're a child or someone living with others, writing in a physical diary can be stressful due to the constant fear that someone might read it without your knowledge.

Loom alleviates that anxiety by providing an authentication-enabled, encrypted diary platform!

- Easy creation and retrieval of private diary entries
- Customizable interface: font styles, font size, page color, background color, and text color

## How It Works

1. Create an account and sign in securely.
2. Write your diary entries directly in the app.
3. Your entries are encrypted using a key you choose.
4. Access your encrypted entries anytime by providing the same key.

## Why Loom?

Writing a diary can be deeply personal, and privacy is essential. Loom gives you peace of mind by combining security and convenience, so your thoughts stay truly yours.
